# Bikesharing: Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
For this module/ challenge we worked with Tableau, we first had to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we had to create a set of visualizations to: Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. And finally, we had to form a Tableau Story that would be used in a data analyiss portfolio. .

This assignment consisted of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present our results. We had to submit the following; Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format, Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis, Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story.

CHECKOUT TIMES FOR USERS: This line graph suggests that the common duration of time for Citibikes are about 5-7 minutes in length. The data indicates that clients are utilizing the bikes for short distances. According to the linegraph, as time progresses there is a decline in number of bike users. 

CHECKOUT TIMES BY GENDER: This line graph suggests that the data categorized by gender, displays that there are siginificantly more men that utilize Citibikes. The category of Women is shown on the red line, which is in the middle. And the Unknown gender category is indicated as the least amount of bikers--which is the blue line. 

TRIPS BY WEEKDAY FOR EACH HOUR: In this heatmap, the most popular time indicates Thursday at 5pm and 6pm---those blocks of time are a deep red color.  Monday and Tuesday 5pm and 6pm also display a lighter shade of that deep red---still indicating that 5pm and 6pm, seem to be popluar times during the workweek. 

TRIPS BY GENDER (WEEKDAY PER HOUR): The heatmap below is categorized by days and subcategorized by gender. Men users typically utilize Citibike the most, Women are the second most Citibike users category, and last is the Unknown gender category. 

USER TRIPS BY GENDER BY WEEKDAY: In this heatmap, the most rider/ subscribers are Male, which is consistent with the previous heatmaps regarding gender. Mostly men utilize Citibikes over Women and  Unknown genders.
